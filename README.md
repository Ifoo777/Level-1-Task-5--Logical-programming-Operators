# Level 1 Task 5 -Logical programming: Operators

## Task 1

Follow these steps:

● Note: For this task, you will need to create an HTML file to get input from a
user.

● Create a new JavaScript file in this folder called seven11.js.

● Create a program to determine if a number input by the user is divisible by
7 and 11, either 7 or 11, or neither.

● Output the answer, depending on the result, with one of the following
statements:

○ “[input] is divisible by both 7 and 11.”

○ “[input] is divisible by 11.”

○ “[input] is divisible by 7.”

○ “[input] is divisible by neither 7 nor 11.”

## Task 2

Follow these steps:

● Create a new JavaScript file in this folder called quadrilaterals.js.

● There are multiple quadrilaterals, all with their own properties. Create a
program that receives the length of each side and the angles of each
corner (these can be hard-coded) and determines whether the shape is a
square, a rectangle, a rhombus or a parallelogram.

● The properties of each are as follows:

○ Square: All sides equal, all corners 90 degrees.

○ Rectangle: Opposite sides equal, all corners 90 degrees.

○ Rhombus: All sides equal, opposite angles equal. Two opposite
corners are less than 90 degrees, the other two corners are more
than 90 degrees.

○ Parallelogram: Opposite sides equal, opposite angles equal. Two
opposite corners are less than 90 degrees, the other two corners are
more than 90 degrees.

When labelling the variables for your program, use this diagram below as a
guide:

corner 4     side1    corner1

----------------

|side4         | side2

----------------

corner3      side3    corner2
